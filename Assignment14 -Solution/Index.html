                 The President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Army,

        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p><h2>
            In 1776, a Military Department was created within 
            the government of the East India Company at Kolkata.
             Its main function was to record orders that were issued to 
             the army by various departments of the East India Company 
             for the territories under its control.

With the Charter Act of 1833, the Secretariat of the government of the East India Company was reorganised
 into four departments,
 including a Military Department. The army in the presidencies of Bengal, 
 Bombay and Madras functioned as respective Presidency Armies until 1 April
  1895, when they were unified into a single Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided into four commands, namely Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal, Madras (including Burma), 
and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).</h2>
